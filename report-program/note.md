& day1
- I built the basic structure of a report program.
- StackForMessage class is used for a container of messages. 
- Employee class is used for each employee. 
- Main class is actually grasping all employees information by the collection emps, to which hashmap is initialized.

- This proram has lots of pitfalls.
