// Report Program.
// Each employee can write reports which are going to be given to employers.
// Each employee only can read their own reports. While, employers can read all reports. 
// I am going to use linked list as stack to sort reports in recently sent order, 
// and queue to send reports in sent order.
// In addition, I am going to use hashmap to map each employee to each key.
